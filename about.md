I&nbsp;enjoy monospaced fonts and&nbsp;four spaces per&nbsp;tab; properly 
formatted sources and&nbsp;online documentation; the&nbsp;internet, Github, 
Linux, Mint Xfce; crisp shirts; canoeing, hiking; Katka; coffee, cafes, tee,
movies, wasting time, Half Life 1; Google; Youtube, learning new things,
writing, pencils, reading; Deep Purple;
 
I've written in **php**, **html**, (pl/){0,1}**sql** and (ba|k)**sh**, sed, awk and /regexp?/ for&nbsp;money.
